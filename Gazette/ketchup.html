    <h3>Introduction To Ketchup Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Ketchup, the ubiquitous red sauce found on tables and in refrigerators across the United States, has long been considered a staple condiment for many Americans. However, recent research suggests that this popular sauce may not be as harmless as we once thought. Ketchup's strong flavor and other qualities make it a bad condiment for many dishes, and its excessive use has become a culinary sin.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Issue</h3>
    <p>
      One of the main issues with ketchup is its overpowering flavor.
    </p>
    <p>It is too:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Salty</li>
      <li>Sweet</li>
      <li>Sour</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because of this it can easily dominate any dish it's added to. The intense taste of ketchup can mask the natural flavor of other ingredients, making it difficult to appreciate the nuances of a well-prepared meal. This is particularly problematic when it comes to more delicate dishes, such as fish, salads, or roasted vegetables, where the subtle flavors can be completely lost under the heavy-handedness of ketchup.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>More Downsides</h3>
    <p>
      Another downside to ketchup is its texture. It's thick and gloopy, making it difficult to spread evenly. Ketchup can also make food soggy, ruining the texture of otherwise crispy or crunchy items like French fries or chips. In addition, ketchup can leave a sticky residue on fingers, utensils, and plates, which can be annoying and hard to clean.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Negative Health Effects</h3>
    <p>
      Ketchup is also a nutritional minefield. While it's made from tomatoes, which are a healthy source of vitamins and antioxidants, most commercial ketchup brands contain high levels of added sugars and sodium. A single tablespoon of ketchup can have up to four grams of sugar, which is equivalent to a teaspoon of granulated sugar. This excess sugar consumption can lead to weight gain, diabetes, and other health problems. Moreover, the high sodium content in ketchup can cause bloating, water retention, and other cardiovascular issues.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <p>
      While it's acceptable to use ketchup on 2 foods, these are: 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Hotdogs</li>
      <li>Hamburgers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Ketchup should not be considered a go-to condiment for other dishes. Instead, we should explore alternative condiments that can enhance the flavor of our meals without overwhelming them. For example, mustard is a great alternative to ketchup, as it provides a tangy flavor without the excessive sweetness. Similarly, salsa or guacamole can add some zing to salads or grilled meats, without making them overly sweet.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      In conclusion, while ketchup may be a beloved condiment for many Americans, its overpowering flavor, texture, and nutritional deficiencies make it a bad condiment for many dishes. It's time to rethink our use of this red sauce and explore healthier and more flavorful alternatives that can elevate our meals to new heights.
