        <h1>I am making a game engine for creating text based adventure games</h1>
        <p>this engine will be able to take regular text inputs and information you choose and then will compile all of your stats names maps and whatever into a modular script that will be the game you created, this engine should be easy enough to use that a todler could use it, one thing though, I am going to leave the css empty for the outputted game, you will be able to edit the css in the game engine, but if you put nothing it will add nothing and your game would look shit, so there is still some resemblance of coding to it (I may start the css so that everything can be positioned correctly on the screen, but excluding that the css and styling of the game is all up to the creator which might add a sense of personal accomplishment to it or more a sense of personalization)</p>
